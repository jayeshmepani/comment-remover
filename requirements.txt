# requirements.txt
# -----------------
# There are NO external dependencies required for `universal_stripper.py`.
#
# Note: Although the script imports multiple modules (like `argparse`, `re`, 
# `json`, `subprocess`, `tokenize`, `pathlib`, etc.), all of these are natively 
# built into the Python Standard Library. 
#
# You do NOT need to run `pip install` for any of them. They come pre-installed 
# with Python 3.6+.
